## Welcome to the README for the GroundwaterDupuitPercolator component submodule.

### Installation
To use this component, you will need to install Landlab. Two options for
installation are available:
[a pre-packaged binary](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/install/index.html)
distributed through PyPI or conda-forge and a
[source code installation](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/development/install/index.html#developer-install).

The dependencies of the Landlab package are described [here]().

### Documentation
The documentation specific to this component is housed within the Landlab
documentation. There are two pages in the documentation that are most relevant
to this component:
- [The component API](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/components/groundwater.html).
- [A page](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/components/dupuit_theory.html#dupuit-theory)
describing the theory and numerical implementation of this component.

If you are new to Landlab and components, we recommend that you also look at the
[User Guide](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/user_guide/index.html),
in particular, the page on the [model grid](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/user_guide/grid.html), and [components](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/user_guide/components.html).

### Tutorials
There is a [Jupyter notebook in the Landlab Tutorials repository](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/landlab/landlab/release?filepath=notebooks/tutorials/groundwater/groundwater_flow.ipynb)
that describes the use of the `GroundwaterDupuitPercolator`.
The link takes you to a binder instance of this notebook. Its filepath within
the repository is `notebooks/tutorials/groundwater/groundwater_flow.ipynb`

### Tests of this Component
Along with the rest of the Landlab package, this component uses
[`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) 
to  discover and run its tests. General information about running the Landlab
tests can be found [here](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/development/install/test.html#testing).
